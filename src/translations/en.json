    "introduction": "At Amazin Timber, we are fully and unconditionally committed to operating in compliance with all applicable laws, standards, and regulations that aim to protect forest resources, the environment, and human rights. Two of the most important international regulations guiding our processes are the EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) and the U.S. Lacey Act.",
    "eudr": {
      "title": "EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation)",
      "description": "The EUDR requires operators and traders placing products on the EU market to ensure that these products do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation. This entails effective due diligence across the entire supply chain: understanding the origin of the timber, land-use conditions, and verifying the legality of harvesting, transport, and processing. We implement robust procedures to verify legal and sustainable origin, including maps, certifications, audits, and documented traceability—ensuring that none of our products violate EUDR requirements."

When we sell or export to the U.S.—or when our partners do—we ensure that all materials comply with legal requirements of origin, documentation, and certification. We maintain comprehensive records demonstrating compliance with the forestry laws of the countries of origin, thereby preventing illegal timber from entering the supply chain."

        "documentation": "Mandatory documentation: we require all suppliers to provide licenses, internationally recognized forest certifications (e.g., FSC, PEFC) or equivalents, legal extraction, transport and processing authorizations, location maps, and land-use verification, among others.",
        "audits": "Audits & independent checks: where necessary, we conduct field audits or engage independent entities to verify the accuracy of information and legal compliance at the source.",
        "traceability": "Traceability: from the point of harvest to the final shipment, we maintain clear documentary traceability so that the timber's path can be tracked at any stage.",
